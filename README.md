## Building npm packages in Nix with Napalm

### Basic Napalm usage

Use the `buildPackage` function provided in the [`default.nix`](./default.nix)
for building npm packages (replace `<napalm>` with the path to napalm;
with [niv]: `niv add nmattia/napalm`):

``` nix
let
    napalm = pkgs.callPackage <napalm> {};
in napalm.buildPackage ./. {}
```

All executables provided by the npm package will be available in the
derivation's `bin` directory.

**NOTE**: napalm uses the package's `package-lock.json` (or
`npm-shrinkwrap.json`) for building a package database. Make sure there is
either a `package-lock.json` or `npm-shrinkwrap.json` in the source.
Alternatively provide the path to the package-lock file:

``` nix
let
    napalm = pkgs.callPackage <napalm> {};
in napalm.buildPackage ./. { packageLock = <path/to/package-lock>; }
```

### Napalm with Nix flakes

If you want to use Napalm in your flake project, you can do that by adding it to your overlay. There is also a template, that can help you use napalm in your project. You can use it by running `nix flake init -t "github:nix-community/napalm"`.

## Handling complicated scenarios with Napalm

Examples below assume that you have imported `napalm` in some way.

### Custom node.js version

Napalm makes it quite simple to use custom node.js (with npm) version.
This is controlled via `nodejs` argument. 

**Example 1**

Changing node.js version to the one that is supplied in `nixpkgs`:

```nix
{ napalm, nodejs-16_x, ... }:
napalm.buildPackage ./. {
	nodejs = nodejs-16_x;
}
```

**Example 2**

Changing node.js version to some custom version (just an idea):

```nix
{ napalm, nodejs-12_x, ... }:
let
	nodejs = nodejs-12_x.overrideAttrs (old: rec {
		pname = "nodejs";
		version = "12.19.0";
		sha256 = "1qainpkakkl3xip9xz2wbs74g95gvc6125cc05z6vyckqi2iqrrv";
		name = "${pname}-${version}";

		src = builtins.fetchurl {
			url =
			"https://nodejs.org/dist/v${version}/node-v${version}.tar.xz";
			inherit sha256;
		};
	});
in
napalm.buildPackage ./. {
	inherit nodejs;
}
```

### Pre/Post Npm hooks

Napalm allows to specify commands that are runned before and after every `npm` call.
These hooks work also for nested `npm` calls thanks to npm override mechanism.

**Example**

Patching some folder with executable scripts containing shebangs (that may be generated by npm script):

```nix
{ napalm, ... }:
napalm.buildPackage ./. {
	postNpmHook = ''
	patchShebangs tools 	
	''
}
```

### Multiple package locks

Napalms allows to specify multiple package locks. 
This may be useful for some project which consist of some smaller projects.

**Example**

```nix
{ napalm, ... }:
napalm.buildPackage ./. {
	# package-lock.json that is in the root of the project
	# is not required to be specified in `additionalpackagelocks`
	# If you want to specify it, you can use `packageLock` argument.
	additionalPackageLocks = [
	./frontend/package-lock.json
	./tests/package-lock.json
	];
}
```

### Patching npm packages (before fetching them with npm)

*This is very useful for errors like: `Invalid interpreter`*

Napalm has an ability to patch fetched npm packages before serving them to the npm.
By default patching fixes shebangs and binaries that are localized and the tarballs.
Napalm also updates `package-lock.json` with new `integrity` hashes.

**Example**

To enable patching, just use:

```nix
{ napalm, ... }:
napalm.buildPackage ./. {
	patchPackages = true;
}
```

### Customizing patching mechanism of npm packages

Sometimes it is required to manually patch some package. 
Napalm allows that via `customPatchPackages` attribute.
This attribute is a set of that overrides for packages that will be patched.

**Example**

```nix
{ napalm, ... }:
napalm.buildPackage ./. {
	# Version is not required. When it is not specified it 
	# applies override to all packages with that name.
	#
	# Arguemnts that are passed into custom patch:
	# `pkgs` - Nixpkgs used by Napalm
	# `prev` - Current set that will be passed to mkDerivation
	customPatchPackages."react-native"."0.65.0" = pkgs: prev: {
		EXAMPLE_ENV_VAR = "XYZ";
		buildPhase = ''
		# You can copy some stuff here or run some custom stuff	
		'';
	};
}
```

## How it works ?

TODO

## Napalm - a lightweight npm registry

Under the hood napalm uses its own package regitry. The registry is available
in [default.nix](./default.nix) as `napalm-registry`.

```
Usage: napalm-registry [-v|--verbose] [--endpoint ARG] [--port ARG] --snapshot ARG

Available options:
  -v,--verbose             Print information about requests
  --endpoint ARG           The endpoint of this server, used in the Tarball URL
  --port ARG               The to serve on, also used in the Tarball URL
  --snapshot ARG           Path to the snapshot file. The snapshot is a JSON
                           file. The top-level keys are the package names. The
                           top-level values are objects mapping from version to
                           the path of the package tarball. Example: { "lodash":
                           { "1.0.0": "/path/to/lodash-1.0.0.tgz" } }
  -h,--help                Show this help text
```
